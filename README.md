# ilo sama RAIL German Decal Library
> This is the official GitHub repository for the iR German Decal Library. The decals within are intended for use within liveries for train simulators.

## Content
This library aims to provide all decals commonly found on German railways. This includes but is not limited to normed decals as per ISO 7010 or TSI PRM, decals found on Deutsche Bahn trains or trains of other TOCs/organisations, or decals found on regular infrastructure.
All decals are provided as a .png image file and a .xcf GIMP project file.

## Requests/Suggestions
Missing something? In case you have any requests or suggestions for additional decals for this library, you may create an issue with the "request" label. If possible, please include appropriate reference material for the decal you want represented.

## Usage
You may utilise the files in this repository for your own train liveries. However, while doing so, you must follow the following rules unless disclosed in a prior agreement
1. **Do not use the files without crediting us (ilo sama RAIL)**
2. **Do not use the files outside of train simulators**
3. **Do not use the files commercially**

## Known Issues
- Fonts in DB WLS decals
  The font in our DB WLS decals are inaccurate due to the real font (DB WLS) not being available. For now, as a replacement, we are using Nimbus Sans L, a free alternative to Helvetica. We may attempt to recreate DB WLS in the future, though we cannot confirm anything quite yet.
